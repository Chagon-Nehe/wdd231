        <section id="overview">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This document outlines the plan for "HealthcareConnect," a front-end web application designed to serve as a directory of local healthcare providers and clinics. This site plan acts as a blueprint for the design and development phases, detailing the core components, purpose, and visual considerations for the project.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="site-name">
            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <h3>HealthcareConnect</h3>
            <p>This name was selected to clearly communicate the primary function of the website: connecting users with healthcare services. It implies accessibility and ease of use, aligning with the project's goal to simplify finding medical professionals. It's concise, memorable, and directly relevant to the healthcare sector.</p>
            <p><em>Optional domain availability:</em> healthcareconnect.org (or .info, .health, etc.)</p>
        </section>

        <section id="site-purpose">
            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>"HealthcareConnect" aims to provide a consolidated, easily searchable resource to make it easier and faster to find and connect with local doctors and hospitals.  The site will feature a browsable directory of medical experts and facilities, with each listing offering key information such as name, specialty, address, contact, hours, and a description of services. </p>
            <p>The core services and information provided will include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A browsable directory of local healthcare providers and clinics. </li>
                <li>Key information for each provider/clinic: Name, Specialty(s), Full Address, Contact Phone Number, Clinic Hours / Availability, a concise description of services offered. </li>
                <li>A clickable link to a static map (e.g., Google Maps link) for easy navigation. </li>
                <li>Users can sort listings by popular medical disciplines (e.g., "General Practice", "Pediatrics"). </li>
                <li>Location-based search functionality to filter results by city, town, or neighborhood. </li>
                <li>A "Book Appointment" button on each listing. </li>
                <li>Dynamic data rendering of provider information loaded from a JSON file. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The project intends to improve accessibility to care, empower informed choices by providing essential information upfront, and support local healthcare ecosystems by giving a platform for providers to be found. </p>

        <section id="scenarios">
            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <p>Here are some questions a site visitor (representing the target audience) might ask:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>"I've just moved to Blantyre and need to find a reputable pediatrician for my child. How can I quickly find one with good reviews and convenient hours?"</li>
                <li>"My tooth has been bothering me for days, and I need to find a dentist that offers emergency appointments this afternoon. Can I filter by availability?"</li>
                <li>"I'm looking for a physiotherapist near my workplace in Limbe. Can I search by location and see their contact details?"</li>
                <li>"What services does the 'ABC Clinic' offer, and what are their typical operating hours?"</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
